2. WHEN I train a knowledge base THEN the system SHALL show training progress and status updates
3. WHEN I query a knowledge base THEN the system SHALL return relevant results with source citations
4. WHEN I manage knowledge base members THEN the system SHALL allow adding, removing, and updating user permissions
5. WHEN I view knowledge base statistics THEN the system SHALL display usage metrics and performance data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want improved user management capabilities, so that I can efficiently handle user accounts and their access rights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new user THEN the system SHALL validate email uniqueness and generate secure credentials
